# Template for the news website

Basically, the given template is the reproduction of [the template developed by HotMagazine](http://nunforest.com/hotmagazine-demo/default/). While at first glance it might appear to be a complete copy of the original template, in fact, it differs a lot from the original one under the hood.

### Implemented Features:
* Instead of using libraries, all carousels have been developed from scratch with the customization and responsiveness support
* Unlike the original template, which was developed in 2015, the newer version makes use of new CSS-technologies like Flexbox and CSSGrid aimed at making a website fully responsive

### Techologies/tools used in the project:
* HTML
* Sass
* Vanilla JavaScript
* Webpack (Babel included)
